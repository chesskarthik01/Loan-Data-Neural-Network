# Loan-Data-Neural-Network
Using tensorflow and keras, create a neural network that'll predict if people will be likely to pay back a loan or not.
<br> Tensorflow 2.0 used to support the keras syntax.
<br> Externally viewing the notebook in binder mostly renders it well, apart from the plot for loss vs val_loss which unfortunately won't show up.
